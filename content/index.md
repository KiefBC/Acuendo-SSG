## What drives me

- **Programming Languages**: The elegance of Go's simplicity and Rust's safety
- **PC Gaming**: The freedom of choice in hardware, mods, and game complexity
- **Strength Training**: Building both physical and mental resilience
- **Continuous Learning**: Each domain teaches lessons applicable to the others

## My current favorites (by category)

### Programming

1. Go - For its simplicity and concurrency
2. Rust - For its memory safety and performance
3. Python - For rapid prototyping and versatility

### Gaming

1. Strategy games (Total War, Civilization)
2. RPGs with deep customization
3. Indie games that push creative boundaries

### Fitness

1. Compound lifts (deadlifts, squats, bench)
2. Progressive overload principles
3. Consistency over perfection

Here's what elegant Go code looks like:

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, concurrent world!")
    
    ch := make(chan string, 3)
    go func() { ch <- "goroutines" }()
    go func() { ch <- "are" }()
    go func() { ch <- "awesome" }()
    
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        fmt.Println(<-ch)
    }
}
```
